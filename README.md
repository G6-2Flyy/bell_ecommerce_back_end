# E-Commerce Back End

## Description

The purpose of this project is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. This application entailed configuring a working Express.js API that uses Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. Use of these latest technologies to build back ends enable companies to compete effectively against other e-commerce companies in the market space. 

- The motivation for this project stems from finding ways to grant companies with a competitive edge.
- E-commerce plays a significant role that spans the spectrum of industries. Data suggests that in 2021, within the United States alone, online purchases of electronics reportedly generated an estimated $2.5 trillion.
- E-commerce giants such as Shopify, and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes, making it necessary for developers to understand the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites.
